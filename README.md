Multi-lingua
===========

A CraftBukkit plugin for Minecraft Server.

Multi-lingua hooks in the Factions plugin and allows players to 'speak' in different languages. Members of a particular faction can always understand each other, but non-faction players will only see gibberish.

Multi-lingua can also be configured to make speech break up over distance, becoming less intelligible the further apart players are.
